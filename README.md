BMI Calculator

This is a Java program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.

The program takes the following input from the user:

    Name
    Age
    Weight
    Height
    Gender

The program then calculates the user's BMI and displays it to the user. The program also displays the user's BMI category, which is based on the following guidelines:

    Underweight: BMI < 18.5
    Normal: BMI 18.5 - 24.9
    Overweight: BMI 25 - 29.9
    Obese: BMI 30 or greater

The program also calculates the user's basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories a person burns at rest. The BMR is calculated using the following formulas:

    Male: BMR = 66 + (13.7 * weight in kg) + (5 * height in cm) - (6.8 * age in years)
    Female: BMR = 655 + (9.6 * weight in kg) + (1.8 * height in cm) - (4.7 * age in years)

The program then displays the user's BMR to the user.
How to use

To use the program, clone the repository and open the BMICalculator.java file in a Java IDE. Then, compile and run the program. The program will prompt you for the following information:

    Name
    Age
    Weight
    Height
    Gender

After you enter the information, the program will calculate your BMI and BMR and display them to you.
Limitations

The BMI calculator is a simple program and does not take into account other factors that can affect a person's health, such as muscle mass and body fat percentage. Therefore, the results of the BMI calculator should not be used as a definitive measure of a person's health.
Further development

The BMI calculator could be further developed to take into account other factors that can affect a person's health, such as muscle mass and body fat percentage. This would allow the program to provide more accurate and personalized results.

The BMI calculator could also be developed to include a graphical user interface (GUI). This would make the program more user-friendly and accessible to a wider range of people.
